                        Solidsense is a innovative company that brings ideas to live - emotional surroundings, experiences, installations and interactive exhibits, <br>
                        helping companies on delivering stunning experiences, participate on planning, execution and production on individual solutions to bring <br>
                        their dreams into reality using technology.<br>
                        We have the privilege to work with solidsense on a solution of Event Media Streaming, this platform runs on AWS, and together <br>
                        we improve the availability, cost and performance of the solution.<br>
                        The solution utilizes various aws services like ElasticBeanstalk, RDS, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, Cognito, Chime and other services.<br>
                        We help defining a good IaC aproach using Terraform, multi-account structure, Disaster Recovery strategy, etc, <br>
                        and also implement all of these best practices in the AWS Infrastructure optimizing the cost, availability and performance.<br>

                        <br>
                        Between the various upgrades made to the infrastructure, we can cite some memorables:<br>
                            - IaC using Terraform, and Azure DevOps to deploy the code using Pipelines.<br>
                            - Improve Auto-Scaling configuration to fit the needs of an Event (huge spikes in traffic in minutes).<br>
                            - Improve security using SecretsManager, Security Group Chaining, Cloudfront Origin Access Control, etc.<br>
                            - Improve Backup in a multi-account setup using AWS Backup.<br>

                        <br>

                        Some of the 

                    <h4>Terraform Project Re-Structuring</h4><br>
                    The Event Media Streaming Platform was supposed to be installed for various clients in a
                    3 stage account setup,<br> therefore we adapted the flat Terraform Project Structure to serve for
                    this purpose.<br>
                    <br>
                    Lets first have a look on the new structure of the terraform project.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/terraform.jpg" alt="Terraform" width="300"> <br>
                    <br>

                    Inside the infrastructure folder you have the main tf file. main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf if
                    needed.<br>
                    In this folder you will execute your terraform commands.<br>
                    Inside the subfolder env you have the tfvars file for each environment, in this example dev, qa
                    and prod. <br>
                    Also a backend.conf file for each environment (qa-backend.conf etc)<br>
                    You will init the project with the .conf file for the environment you want to address.<br>
                    The plan, apply or delete commands you will execute with the tfvars file for the env
                    (dev,qa,prod).<br>

                    <br>
                    The diagram shows a simplified infrastructure/env folder.<br>
                    Indeed there were subfolders under the env folder for each customer and and each of them will
                    be the tfvars files for the 3 environments.<br>
                    Having:<br>
                    -infrastructure<br>
                    --env<br>
                    ---customer1<br>
                    ----dev.tfvars<br>
                    ----qa.tfvars<br>
                    ----prod.tfvars<br>
                    ---customer2<br>
                    ----dev.tfvars<br>
                    ----qa.tfvars<br>
                    ----prod.tfvars<br>
                    ......more customers
                    <br>
                    This way all configuration files for one customer were in one common folder and the
                    customers were all grouped under the folder env.<br>
                    The main.tf file in the infrastructure root filder will include all the modules you want to
                    create
                    for your environment.<br>
                    Modules were introduced and these modules were placed in the subfolder 'modules'<br>
                    This way no copy & paste code was produced, the project structure was kept simple and
                    supported the multi client deployment requirements.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Loadbalancing Optimization</h4><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/aws-alb.jpg" alt="5Pillars" width="300"> <br>
                    <br>

                    Solidsense scale out requirements were besides the normal Loadbalancing capabilites and
                    features.<br>
                    When a event started in the evening, within 1 minute up to 5000 users made their login and
                    started using the media streaming services and the applications.<br>
                    A scaling policy based on CPU or Network metrics cannot handle this, from where the scale out events
                    will be triggered and until the new instances are fully started, it will take more than 3 minutes
                    and
                    the users will face a bad user experience.<br>
                    Saying this, the classical loadbalancing triggers will not work.<br>
                    Since the events occure on a given time and date and for a given duration, a time based scheduled
                    Load Balancing is the best approach.
                    15 min before the event, the desired count for the Elastic Beanstalk Environments will be increased
                    (based
                    on a calculation of the number of event users), for example from 1 to 10.
                    And after the event the desired count will be set back to 1.<br>
                    Before tests on multiple EC2 instances and higher Load we evaluated the best instance size
                    for a small number of users based on the hardware requirements of the application.<br>
                    Solidsense performed new Loadtests and the results were outstanding.<br>
                    A lambda with API Gateway & a simple UI in the Admin Application was written and deployed the
                    change the time scheduled Loadbalancing by event data and user number.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Security, Reliability & Operational Excellence Improvements</h4><br>
                    We analyzed the infrastructure, also used SecurityHub and Trusted Advisor and addressed some
                    Security Issues to resolve.<br>
                    The ElasticBeanstalk application was adapted to use only role based policies, all credentials
                    were moved to SecretsManager, Security Group Chaining was introduced, all S3 Buckets for CloudFront
                    were accessed only with Origin Access Control.<br>
                    Loggin was enabled for EB, EC2, the Loadbalancers, RDS, VPC Flowlogs, S3 Access and others.<br>
                    Monitoring was enhanced and alarms created for EC2, RDS, ALB and Lambdas.<br>
                    A backup strategy was defined and implemented.
                    Best practices of the 5 pillars were applied.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/5pillars.webp" alt="5Pillars" width="500"> <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides the already mentioned measures for Security, Reliability & Operational Excellence<br>
                    the Perfomance Efficiency had been optimized together with the changes on Loadbalancing and
                    Lambda configurations.<br>
                    Cost Optimization was addressed by scaling down the EB environments to 0 when no event was
                    scheduled, <br>
                    the correct sizing of the EC2 and RDS instances and use of serveless services like Lambda and API
                    Gateway.<br>
