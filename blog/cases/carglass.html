                    <p></p>
                    <p>For about 1 year SCC Brasil worked together with the Carglass internal IT Team to improve their
                        Cloud Infrastructure<br>
                        Carglass is the biggest company in germany for windshield repair and replacement.<br>
                        See company site:
                        <a href="https://www.carglass.de/" class="page-scroll" target="_blank">Carglass </a><br>
                        The first action was analyze the current setup and define epics to optimize the aws
                        infrastructure.<br>
                        Carglass was already in progress to migrate their On Premise infrastructre to AWS.
                        They used EC2 to migrate VMs, which for example had 3rd party software running for various
                        internal applications.<br>
                        The main business application was running on a Kubernets cluster, also on EC2 machines. Setup by
                        kubectl, so far EKS was not used.<br>
                        RDS was also used as backend for various applications.<br>
                        AWS Lambda was used for processing of small tasks, basically for maintenance of the AWS
                        infrastructe, not for business logic yet.<br>
                        The issues were identified and priorized to bring their hybrid infrastructure on another
                        quality level<br>
                        The first epics based on the Review were: Security, Account Structure, Improve RPO and RTO,
                        IaC<br>
                        In this blog let's have a look on 3 maior epics<br>
                        -Reorganize AWS Account Strucure<br>
                        -Improve Desaster Recovery Strategy and therefore RPO and RTO<br>
                        -Strict usage of IaC<br>

                    <h4>Reorganize AWS Account Strucure</h4><br>
                    The current setup was a Master Account and 3 Stage Accounts (DEV, QA & PROD) .<br>
                    It is already a good practice to separate the stages in separate accounts, but since it was
                    neccessary to grant acess to
                    external service providers to the accounts, the separation of all these parties on IAM level to
                    grant only rights to their servers and resources,
                    following the principle of least privilage, was difficult.<br>
                    Too much administrator policies where granted, allowing changes on networking and also on actions on
                    other domain resources.<br>
                    The better approach was to define the account structure more granular and define more dedicated
                    accounts with its on IAM roles.<br>
                    The AWS Whitepaper gives an example for a multi-account scenario.<br>
                    <img src="img/multi-account.jpg" alt="SMM" width="500"> <br>
                    <br>
                    We followed this example with small changes, defining the following account strucuture with AWS
                    Organizations :<br>
                    <b>Organizations Account</b> - Master account with the IAM Users to login<br>
                    <b>Networking Account</b> - Transit Gateway and Direct Connect , Adminstrator Access only for the
                    Network
                    Administator<br>
                    <b>Shared Services Account</b> - Account for shared resoures and services to avoid too much VPC
                    peerings
                    between the other accounts<br>
                    <b>Main Stage Accounts DEV, QA & PROD</b><br>
                    <b>Stage Accounts for external service providers</b><br>
                    <b>Stage Accounts for Oracle and its servie provider</b><br>


                    The separation in these dedicated accounts helped to apply the principle of least privilage,
                    allowing the different roles
                    only access to their resources.<br>
                    The dedicated accounts where much more neatly, allowing the admins to stop or teminate manual
                    created test/poc resources.
                    Also consolidated billing helped the management to monitor the aws costs on a better
                    granularity.<br><br>

                    <h4>Improve Desaster Recovery Strategy and therefore RPO and RTO</h4><br>
                    All RDS instances where already creating daily snapshots, also EBS volumes, so the RPO was in most
                    cases acceptable, here were only small improvements neccessary,
                    but there a TODO with the RTO.<br>
                    Not all resources where created with IaC (CloudFormation was used in general), some where created
                    manually on the AWS Console
                    and many of the resources created with IaC were modified over the time manually on the AWS Console
                    ( and not the Cfn Stack),<br>
                    which caused drifts on many Stacks and therefore possible problems when updating or re-creating
                    these resources.
                    To allow the team to re-create all resources in the case of a desaster recovery, the strict usage of
                    IaC
                    must be implemented.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Strict usage of IaC and deployment with CI/CD</h4><br>

                    The CloudFormation Stacks were re-structured :<br>
                    -The stacks were layered to better separate the logical and strucutural elements:<br>
                    <img src="img/cfn-layering.jpg" alt="SMM" width="500"> <br>
                    A VPC Stack would now only contain VPC and Network resources, but no other resources like for
                    example S3 Buckets.<br>
                    Therefore the application developers never had to touch VPC or Route53 Stacks, but only their
                    Application Layer Stacks.<br>
                    -The stacks were ordered in the git repo by their layers to allow them to re-deploy in the correct
                    orders.<br>
                    Cross-References with Outputs in Inputs Values were used, but in this case of course the Stack
                    containing the Output must be
                    deployed first.<br>
                    -The Stacks used in 3 Stage Accounts were unified to a single stack and parameterized instead of
                    having 3
                    stacks almost being 95% equaly.<br>
                    - All Stacks were deployed by Jenkins<br>
                    -Drift detection problems were sent by SNS Notifications<br>
                    <br>
                    <p></p>

                    <h4>Cost Optimizations</h4><br>
                    The map programm was applied to the customer.<br>
                    Since the customer migrated existing VMs/Servers from OnPremise to AWS, the AWS Migration
                    Acceleration Program
                    was a real good fit to save costs for Carglass.<br>
                    See more infos on<br>
                    <a href="https://aws.amazo<br>n.com/migration-acceleration-program/" class="page-scroll"
                        target="_blank">AWS Migration Acceleration Program</a><br>
                    After you create your server list in the migration hub and migrate to EC2, you can get discounts on
                    basically any
                    resource on aws which is tagged with the correct map tags:<br>
                    - Key: "aws-migration-project-id"<br>
                    Value: "MPE06XX"<br>
                    - Key: "map-migrated"<br>
                    Value: "d-server-01zt13xxxxxxxxx"<br>

                    <br>
                    The EC2 instance sizes were optimized and Lambdas created to shut down and restart instances which
                    were not <br>
                    needed 24/7, but only during business hours.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4> Training and documentation</h4><br>
                    SCC Brasil held a couple of AWS training sessions to the infrastructe team to enable them to
                    maintain the AWS infrastructe all
                    alone in the future.
                    Also a lot of documentation was written in the company Confluence, including Runbooks, Best
                    practices, Troube Shooting etc<br>
                    <br>
                    At the end of the project the account structure was cleaned up, IaC was strictly used, this way a
                    lot of problems removed, the
                    costs were optimized and the customer was enabled to manage its AWS platform .
