                    <p>For about 1 year SCC Brasil worked together with the Carglass Germany internal IT Team on their Migration to AWS<br>
                        <br>
                        Carglass is the leading vehicle glass repair and replacement company across 25 countries,
                        like Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Brazil, <br> Chile and many more. 
                        Also in Germany Carglass is the biggest company for windshield repair and replacement.<br>
                        See company site:
                        <a href="https://www.carglass.de/" class="page-scroll" target="_blank">Carglass </a><br><br>
                        <br>
           
             
                        Carglass was already in progress to migrate their On Premise infrastructure to AWS, 
                        but did not have enough resources to proceed and complete the migration from OnPremise to AWS
                        within the the ambitious schedule. Thats why we joined their team to support them achieving their goals.<br>
                        They used EC2 to migrate OnPremise, VMs, which for example had 3rd party software running for various
                        internal applications.<br>
                        The main business application was running on a Kubernets cluster, also on EC2 machines. Setup by
                        kubectl, so EKS was not used.<br>
                        RDS was also used as backend for various applications.<br>
                        AWS Lambda was used for processing of small tasks, basically for maintenance of the AWS
                        infrastructure, not for business logic yet.<br>
                        CloudFormation was used as infrastructure as Code Tool.<br>
                        The first action was analyze the current setup and define epics to optimize the aws
                        infrastructure and accelerate and complete the migration.<br>
                        We focused than on IaC, the AWS Account Structure, Cost-Optimization, Improvement of RPO and RTO
                        and of course on the ongoing Migration of resources still OnPremise <br>
                        <br>
                        In this blog let's have a look on the most important epics<br>
                        -Reorganize AWS Account Strucure<br>
                        -Define and Improve Desaster Recovery Strategy and therefore RTO<br>
                        -Strict usage of IaC - CloudFormation<br>
                        -Cost-Opmimization<br>

                    <h4>Reorganize AWS Account Structure</h4><br>
                    The current setup already contained a  Master Account and Stage Accounts<br>
                    It is already a good practice to separate the stages in separate accounts, but since it was
                    neccessary to also grant acess to<br>
                    external service providers to the accounts, the separation of all these parties on IAM level to
                    grant only rights to their servers and resources,<br>
                    following the principle of least privilage, was quite difficult implementing on IAM and policy level.<br>
                    The better approach was to define the account structure more granular and define more dedicated
                    accounts with its on IAM roles.<br>
                    The AWS Whitepaper gives an example for a multi-account scenario.<br>
                    Please have also a look in our blog about defining the multi account structure for your organization<br>      
                    <a href="../aws/multi-account.html" class="page-scroll">AWS Multi Account Setup</a><br>
                    We followed this example with small changes, which allowed for 
                    example only the Network Adminstrator to make changes on Direct Connect, Transit Gateway and Network resources.  
                    On the other side, the LeadDevs and DevOps or Service Providers still could to assume a Adminstrator Role 
                    in their Stage accounts. <br>
                    The dedicated accounts where much more neatly, allowing the admins to stop or teminate manual
                    created test/poc resources.<br>
                    Also consolidated billing helped the management to monitor the aws costs on a better
                    granularity.<br><br>

                    <h4>Define and Improve Desaster Recovery Strategy and therefore RPO and RTO</h4><br>
                    First we had to define the Expectations on RPO and RTO together with Carglass.<br>
                    All RDS instances where already creating daily snapshots, also EBS volumes, so the RPO <br>
                    was already quite well, here were only small improvements neccessary, for example on the RDS Snapshot Settings and Scheduling. <br>

                    The RTO left some potential for improvements<br>
                    Not all resources where yet created with IaC (CloudFormation was used in general), some where created
                    manually on the AWS Console, due to urgent requirements in the migration process. <br>
                    Also some of the resources created with IaC were modified over the time manually on the AWS Console<br>
                    due to urgent production issues, which caused drifts on some Stacks and therefore possible problems when updating the resources by CloudFormation.<br>
                    To allow the team to re-create all resources in the case of a desaster recovery and therefore 
                    achieve a real short RTO,  the strict usage of
                    IaC must be applied consequently.<br>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Strict usage of IaC (CloudFormation) and deployment with Jenkins Pipeline</h4><br>

                    The CloudFormation Stacks were re-structured :<br>
                    -The stacks were layered to better separate the logical and strucutural elements:<br>
                    <img src="img/cfn-layering.jpg" alt="SMM" width="500"> <br>
                    Please have also a look in our blog on structuring CloudFormation Templats to get 
                    more informations about this :<br>
                    <a href="../aws/cfn-structure.html" class="page-scroll">How to organize CloudFormation Templates </a><br>
                    A VPC Stack would now only contain VPC and Network resources, but no other resources like for
                    example S3 Buckets.<br>
                    Therefore the application developers never had to touch VPC or Route53 Stacks, but only their
                    Application Layer Stacks.<br>
                    -The stacks were ordered in the git repo by their layers to allow them to re-deploy in the correct
                    orders.<br>
                    Cross-References with Outputs in Inputs Values were used, but in this case of course the Stack
                    containing the Output must be
                    deployed first.<br>
                    -Some Stacks used in 3 Stage Accounts were unified to a single stack and parameterized instead of
                    having 3 stacks with a lot of Copy & Paste.<br>
                    - All Templates were deployed by Jenkins, Pipelines for CloudFormation Deployment were introduced<br>
                    - A Jenkins Pipeline to automatically create Deployment Pipelines for each Template and each stage was coded in Groovy.
                    If a new Stack was added, this Pipeline must be triggered and it would create new Deployment Pipelines for each stage<br>
                    -Drift detection problems were sent by SNS Notifications to avoid new Drifts<br>
                    <br>
                    <p></p>

                    <h4>Cost Optimizations</h4><br>
                    The MAP programm was applied to the customer.<br>
                    Since the customer migrated existing VMs/Servers from OnPremise to AWS, the AWS Migration
                    Acceleration Program
                    was a real good fit to save costs for Carglass.<br>
                    See more infos on<br>
                    <a href="https://aws.amazo<br>n.com/migration-acceleration-program/" class="page-scroll"
                        target="_blank">AWS Migration Acceleration Program</a><br>
                    After you create your server list in the migration hub and migrate to EC2, you can get discounts on
                    basically any
                    resource on aws which is tagged with the correct map tags:<br>
                    - Key: "aws-migration-project-id"<br>
                    Value: "MPE06XX"<br>
                    - Key: "map-migrated"<br>
                    Value: "d-server-01zt13xxxxxxxxx"<br>
                    
       

                    <br>
                    The EC2 instance sizes were optimized and Lambdas created to shut down and restart instances which
                    were not <br>
                    needed 24/7, but only during business hours.<br><br>

                    <h4> Training and documentation</h4><br>
                    SCC Brasil held a couple of AWS training sessions to the infrastructure team to enable them to
                    maintain the AWS infrastructure all
                    alone in the future.
                    Also a lot of documentation was written in the company Confluence, including Runbooks, Best
                    practices, Troube Shooting etc<br>
                    <br>
                    We are glad to be able to support the Carglass Germany Team on their Cloud journey, it
                    was a lot of fun to work with the well skilled infrastructure team and hope all the Best for them in the future.<br>
