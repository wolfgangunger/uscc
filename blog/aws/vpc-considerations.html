                    <h4>By Wolfgang Unger</h4><br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
                    <br>
                    February 2024 AWS started to charge not only unused IP addresses but by now all public IP Adresses.<br>
                    Together with the NAT costs, which have increased also a lot over the years, a VPC is now a 
                    considerable cost factor especially for small workloads.<br>
                    If you run 80 microservices and 10 databases, it does not matter so much, but for customers running <br>
                    one or two fargate services or elastic beanstalk apps, the VPCs costs will increase your aws bill considerably.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Why setting up your own VPC?</h4><br>
                    As you might already know, it is best practice, not to use the default VPC in your region, but instead <br>
                    create your own VPC together with your other resources with IaC.<br>
                    There are some reasons to do so.<br>
                    First, the default VPCs differ from region to region and the number of AZs in the region.<br>
                    US east got 6 AZs and therefore 6 subnets, most regions have 3 AZs and therefore 3 subnets, some regions have only 2 AZs and 2 subnets.<br>
                    If you setup your infrastructure based on the us-east-1 region with 6 subnets, you might have problem, when are <br>
                    expanding your business and you want 
                    to setup your resources in a region with less subnets. <br>
                    You VPCs should always be the same.<br>
                    Second, the default VPC is not under your control. <br>
                    AWS makes changes, which might affect your services. <br>
                    When I started long time ago on AWS, the default VPCs used to have 3 public subnets and 3 private subnets.<br>
                    The private subnets are gone by now, so only this change would have made a massive impact on your infrastructure.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>VPC Design Considerations</h4><br>

                    With the latest changes from AWS we have to design our VPC under cost considerations.<br>
                    10 years ago, I would create a VPC with 3 Availability Zones and Subnets, 3 public and 3 private subnets.<br>
                    Most public available CloudFormation Example Templates also used to have this setup. <br>
                    The private subnets need a NAT Gatway to communicate with the Internet, here you have 2 options.<br>
                    One NAT for the 3 private subnets, which is sufficient, but not high available. <br>
                    If the AZ from the NAT fails, the other 2 subnets will no longer be able to communicate with the internet.<br>
                    Therefore best practice was to use a NAT in each Subnet, which is a high availability solution.<br>
                    I used to setup VPCs this way.<br>
                    But today, in 2024, this will be a expensive setup.<br>
                    One NAT will cost you about 30$ a month, so for 3 NATs you pay about 90$ for the NATS, with much traffic even more.<br>
                    NAT Gatways are charged for NAT Gateway Hourly Charge, NAT Gateway Data Processing Charge and Data Transfer Charge. <br>
                    The IP address for the NAT will cost you about 20$ a month, for 3 of them you pay 60$ . <br>
                    So you will have costs of about 150$ a month just for your VPC ( 3 public, 3 private subnets, high availability), even <br>
                    before you have launched the first EC2 instance, RDS or another service.<br>
                    Lets say you have 4 stages, Dev, Int, QA and Prod, you will have 4 x 150$ just VPC costs.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>VPC Design 2024</h4>
                    <br>
       
                    Keeping costs in mind, we should ask ourselves, do we really need 3 AZs and subnets? <br>
                    2 would be fine for high availability. 3 even better, but dispensable for smaller workloads.<br>
                    So a VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets.<br>
                    Still you have to decide, if you want a NAT in each AZ or only one, but by now, at least 
                    you will only double the costs.<br>
                    If you can accept the small risk of a AZ failure, you can go for one NAT for both private subnets.<br>
                    <br>
                    Talking about the CIDR Range you can create a /16 VPC. <br>
                    No reason to use a smaller subnet mask, the CIDR range will not increase costs. <br>
                    Better to have sufficient IP addresses, maybe you need them one day. <br>
                    With 2 public and 2 private subnets, each subnet can the have a /18 CIDR range. <br>
                    With 3 AZs and Subnets you always lose 25% of the available IP addresses by the way.<br>
                    If you create you VPC with IaC, no matter of CloudFormation, Terraform or CDK, you normally <br>
                    want to be able to define the CIDR range as a parameter. <br>
                    You can define the whole CIDR range as parameter or what I normally do, the classB value, the 2nd number of the IP range as parameter.<br>
                    So your VPC would be (10.XXX.0.0/16) and by parameter you can set the second value different for your stages or customer environments. <br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
                    With the new costs on IP addresses and also the NAT costs, we should rethink how to setup a VPC.<br>
                    2 AZs and 2 private/public subnets is a perfect setup for smaller workloads.<br>
                    Use 1 NAT if you want to go for less costs and are willing to accept the really small chance of a AZ failure.<br>
                    For high availability with 2 Subnets you have at least only 2 NATs and not 3 to pay for. <br>
                    The costs on IP addresses are also a way of AWS to push more the usage of IPv6.<br>
                    Unfortunatelly the adaption of IPv6 is still not yet so much advanced.<br>
                    Just take a look in this table on the support for IPv6 only:<br>
                    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ipv6-support.html" target="_blank">IPv6 Support</a><br>
                    But for sure, IPv6 VPCs will be more relavante by now much faster. <br>
                    I will publish a blog on how to setup a IPv6 VPC and how to migrate to IPv6.<br>
