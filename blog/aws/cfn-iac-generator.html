                    <h4>By Wolfgang Unger</h4><br>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
                    How to get started with CloudFormation IaC Generator? <br>
                    Do you want to generate CFN or CDK Code from your existing services or architecture? <br><br>
                    AWS announced the CloudFormation IaC Generator in February 2024.<br>
                    A great new feature I was waiting for years.<br>
                    It's a common use case, you first create resources for a POC in the Web Console to see if <br>
                    everyting works as expected, before you code your IaC and rollout the new services to multiple accounts.<br>
                    Wouldn't it be great and save us a lot of time, if we just could generate the IaC for our POC with <br>
                    a couple of mouse clicks instead of now starting to code the whole architecture in CloudFormation or CDK ?<br>
                    Thats exactly what is IaC Generator serves for, so let's have a look if it really works. <br>

                    <p>
                    <h4>Getting Started</h4><br>
                    If you switch to CloudFormation on the WebConsole you find the IaC Generator in the left menu.<br> <br>
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen0.jpg" alt="iac-gen0" loading="lazy" />
                    <br><br>
                    AWS already provides a description of the 3 major steps,  
                    these steps are: <br> 
                    - Scan account resources<br> 
                    - Create CloudFormation Template<br> 
                    - Import to CloudFormation or CDK <br> 
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen1.jpg" alt="iac-gen1" loading="lazy" />    <br><br>         
                    So first let's scan our resources and press 'Start new Scan'<br>
                    I am trying this in one of my company test and sandbox accounts, where I have developed a lot of POCs, so 
                    there should be something to find.<br> 
                    The scan takes a while but finally gets to Scan Status complete.<br>
                    In this moment we cannot see a list of resources the scan found, we have to move to step 2 and Create a CloudFormation Template. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Create template</h4><br>
                    Now we have to define a template name and also the deletion and update replace policy.<br> 
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen3.jpg" alt="iac-gen3" loading="lazy" />    <br>  <br>    
                    Once done and me go forward, we can finally see the list of scanned resources.<br> 
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen2.jpg" alt="iac-gen2" loading="lazy" />    <br>   <br>        
                    As mentioned, I doing my test in a account which was used for creating a bunch of POCs, so I expected some results ... 
                    but this much?<br>
                    Does the scan run over all regions, not just your current one? <br>
                    I am asking myself, does this make sense? .. and already detect this point is not quite easy. <br>
                    Even so you will have deployed your resources normally in one region, you might have often resources in 
                    the us-east-1 region. <br>
                    In this region, the global resources are normally located, so for example a Certificate for a CloudFront Distribution 
                    must be deployed in us-east-1 and not for example in eu-central-1, where your services run. <br>
                    So showing just the current region might be a limitation, but do we really need all regions? Not sure ... this makes sense.<br>
                    What would actually happen if you select for example a EC2 in region eu-west-1 and now try to create to CloudFormation for eu-central-1,<br>
                    where your are working right now in the Web-Console ? As you know the images are different from region to region, so this 
                    might cause us trouble. <br>
                    I am not going to investigate this behaviour right now, but since I have hundreds of scan results,<br> I decide to 
                    start my test in a fresh new account where I can comprehend more easy, if the scan really works as expected.   <br>

                    <h4>2nd try, Scan resources in new account</h4><br>
                    I have created a new aws account in Organizations for my test and with a fresh new and empty account my 
                    tests should be much easier.<br> The only resource I have created is a IAM role to switch into the account.
                    Besides this, no resources should be find by the Scan function. <br>
                    I am running a new Scan and this is the result for a completly new account with just 2 roles created. <br>
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen4.jpg" alt="iac-gen4" loading="lazy" />    <br>   <br>      
                     So 44 resources were scanned, let's have a look what resources were found, we move to 'Create template' again. <br>
                     I am not going to list all resources here, but first to mention:<br>
                     The scan does not affect all regions. <br>
                     In the results is only 1 VPC, the default VPC in my region eu-central-1 and also just the 3 subnets from this VPC.<br>
                     No other default VPCs are listed. Good to know this by now.<br>
                     What else can be found in a empty, new account?<br>
                     We can see 5 CloudFront Policies, these are also default Policies.<br>
                     Also more from CloudFront, like OriginRequest Policies. <br>
                     This helps us to understand one more important point, the global resources (located in us-east-1) are also found be the Scan. <br>
                     This makes sense, as already discussed earlier. No other regions, but the global resources located in us-east-1. <br>
                     We also find some Default Roles for example and we can also see the 2 Roles created by CloudFormation earlier. <br>
                     <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen5.jpg" alt="iac-gen5" loading="lazy" />    <br>   <br>     
                     Since my 2 Roles were created by CloudFormation, we cannot select them here, which also makes sense.    <br>
                     So basically we can find now the default resources which are already in a region to provide basic functionality like 
                     a default VPC and other resources for the same purpose. <br>
                     Now we can start with creating CloudFormation templates.<br>
                     Before I create a first resource manually, I will try to generate a CloudFormation Stack for the Default VPC. 
                     So let's select the VPC ( only the VPC ) and press Next. <br>
                     Now the Generator will automatically preselect for us the related resources, for a VPC these are quite a 
                     bunch, like the Subnets, Routes, Internet Gateway etc. <br>
                     Pretty nice this feature. <br>
                     <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen6.jpg" alt="iac-gen6" loading="lazy" />    <br>   <br> 
                     I press Create and get now the generated CloudFormation Template for the Default VPC .<br> <br> 
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen7.jpg" alt="iac-gen7" loading="lazy" />    <br>   <br> 
                    You can now select the 3rd step and define the StackName, review your changes and import the resources to CloudFormation.<br> 
                    <img class="blog-image" src="img/iac-gen8.jpg" alt="iac-gen8" loading="lazy" />    <br>   <br> 
                    The VPC import works like a charme and the Default VPC is now imported and asociated to our CFN Template 'DefaultVPC'. 
                    Pretty cool, was quite fast and easy. <br> 
                    I will check the VPC, it got by now tags for CloudFormation, which the other Default VPCs in the other regions don't have. <br> 
                    Nice.<br> 
                    Of course we might not be done a 100% now. <br> 
                    For example this VPC CFN Template got no Parameters. <br> 
                    I use to define Parameters for a VPC, for example the ClassB Range or others. <br> 
                    You still might have to adapt the generated Templates a bit, but still this a huge game changer so far. <br> 
                    Now let's test the Generator on resources created by us .<br> 


                    <h4>Generating more resources</h4><br>
                    I will now launch an EC2 instance and try to generate the CFN Template for it. <br> 
                    I switch to EC2 and launch a Instance in my Default VPC. <br> 
                    To add a little bit of difficulty, I am adding a  User Data Script to the instance to install a Apache. <br> 
                    <i>
                    #!/bin/bash -xe<br> 
                    sudo yum install -y httpd<br> 
                    sudo chkconfig httpd on<br> 
                    sudo service httpd start<br> 
                </i>
                    <br> 
                    Besides this, I select create a new Security Group and also allow Port 80.<br> 
                    The instance becomes healthy and I can also connect to the Webserver by its public IP. <br> <br> 
                    Now let's run the scan again and see how much more resources will be found. <br> 
                    We will now find 50 resources scanned as result, 6 more as our first try. <br> 
                    I will press 'Create Template' and enter 'Webserver' as Template Name. <br> 
                    Again we will get the list of scanned resources to select from, by now 
                    much more resources are disabled to select, because we already added them to our DefaultVPC Stack.<br> 
                    I am looking for 	AWS::EC2::Instance and find my instance, select it and press Next.<br> 
                    The Generator will propose 4 related resources, NetworkInterface, SecurityGroup, Volume and VolumeAttachment.<br> 
                    Perfect, I keep this and press again Next, the Template gets generated.<br> <br> 
                    Lets have a look into the Template, I am interested if the Userdata could be also added correctly.<br> 
                    The Template contains this line:<br> 
                    UserData: "IyEvYmluL2Jhc2ggLXhlCnN1ZG8geXVtIGluc3RhbGwgLXkgaHR0cGQKc3VkbyBjaGtjb25maWcgaHR0cGQgb24Kc3VkbyBzZXJ2aWNlIGh0dHBkIHN0YXJ0"<br> 
                    Userdate is Base64 encoded, so we have to use a Online Converter to decode this value.<br> 
                    And yes, decoded it is exactly the Script I have defined when I was launching the instance.<br> 
                    Pretty cool, this also worked.<br> 
                    But I already saw some lines in the CloudFormation Template which are not really nice ... let's skip this for now,
                    We'll have a look on the generated Stack in detail later on. <br><br>
                    <h4>Import template</h4><br>
                    Now I use the Import Function wait until the Stack ist deployed or better imported in the CloudFormation Console. <br> 
                    The Stack becomes green, now I can test something else.<br> 
                    Since we got by now a CFN Template for our Instance we can delete and re-create it. <br> 
                    If everythings works fine, the instance should be healthy again and the webserver reachable. <br> 
                    So I first save the Template to a Yaml File and delete the Stack. <br> 
                    Once deleted I create a new Stack based on this Tempate. Thats the plan.<br> 
                    But actually the Instance is still running, after the Template was deleted.<br> 
                    If you remember the first page of the wizard to create a Template, besides the Template name <br> 
                    there was also the deletion and update replace policy, which was selected by default with retain and we did
                    not change this. Thats why the instance was not deleted.<br> 
                    So we have to re-create the template and this time set the Policies to 'delete'.<br> 
                    I repeat everything and import the Stack with the name 'Webserver2'.<br> 
                    Once created I save the template as Yaml File and Delete this Stack.<br> 
                    Now the instance really gets deleted, that's what we wanted to see. <br>
                    But the Delete action runs into an error:<br>
                    <i>Resource handler returned message: "Volume vol-0048e2a9fabed97b3 is currently attached to {i-0a51a3145a909fa09}</i><br>
                    Actually the instance was terminated, so a 2nd try should resolve this and it works (without selecting remaining the Volume)<br>
                    Looks like the resources were deleted in wrong order, a DependsOn could solve this .<br>
                    But again, we will have to make a little adapation on the generated Stack. <br>

                    <h4>Redeploy template</h4><br>
                    I now create the instance again with the saved template. <br>
                    I recieve 2 errors on creation.<br>
                    <i>EC2NetworkInterface: Only one primary private IP address can be specified<br>
                    EC2VolumeAttachment: Resource handler returned message: "The volume 'vol-0048e2a9fabed97b3' does not exist.<br><br>
                    </i>
                    The private IP address is indead defined twice in the template:<br>
                    <i>PrivateIpAddress: "172.31.21.103"<br>
                    PrivateIpAddresses:<br>
                    - PrivateIpAddress: "172.31.21.103"<br>
                    &ensp;  Primary: true<br>
                    </i>
                    I fix this by commenting out the first line.<br>
                    Also there are referenced to resource IDs in the template.<br>
                    <i>InstanceId: "i-0a51a3145a909fa09"<br>
                    VolumeId: "vol-0048e2a9fabed97b3"<br>
                </i>
                    But it should be a Ref to the CloudFormation Object, looking like this: <br>
                    <i>InstanceId: !Ref EC2Instance00i0a51a3145a909fa0900kDaoQ<br>
                    VolumeId: !Ref EC2Volume00vol0048e2a9fabed97b30066Rhk <br>
                </i>
                  I fix this also ( and about 5 more wrong Refs) and try it again. <br>
                  Now I get this error :<br>
                  <i>
                    Network interfaces and an instance-level subnet ID may not be specified on the same request <br>
                  </i>
                  Thats the point, where I will stop. <br>
                  I can create this EC2 instance with a example EC2 CFN Template in 5 min. <br>
                  If I need to fix the generated template for 45 minutes, thats not what I wanted to achieve be using <br>
                  the IaC Generator.<br>
                  I wanted to speed up, not to need more time. <br>
                  On the first view it looks quite nice, a template gets generated, nice. <br>
                  But if you take a closer look into the CFN template, you see multiple problems and the fact, it <br>
                  cannot be deployed, mabye only after you have fixed 10 problems, makes it not really a tool which is speeding you up.<br>
                  I think, the Generator needs still a lot of finetuning before we can start to use it.<br>




                    <h5>Other resources</h5>

                    I made also some test with other resources, not just EC2.<br>
                    Since this blog already contains a lot of information, I will not add this here.<br>
                    Maybe I create a 2nd blog about this one day. <br>

                    <br>
                

                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    Well indeed you can generate CloudFormation Templates with the IaC Generator.<br>
                    But you shouldn't take a closer look into the generated File. <br>
                    There a still a lot of issues, the References are pointing the resources on aws not to CloudFormation objects, <br>
                    so you can't delete a stack and re-create or deploy it into another account.<br>
                    DependsOn are missing and of course Parameters are missing. <br>
                    To get these Templates ready for usage, you will have to invest a lot of time to clean them up<br>
                    I doupt you will be faster instead of writing a new Template ( if you have a good set of examples and templates already, this <br>
                    is quite fast) from the Scratch with already Best Practices and well designed Parameters and InputValues and Outputs etc. <br>
                    I think AWS must invest much more time and finetuning in this tool, before it makes sense to use it.<br>
                    Right now you won't save time with the IaC Generator. <br>
                    <br>
