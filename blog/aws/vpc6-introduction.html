                    <h4>By Wolfgang Unger</h4><br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
                    <br>
                    February 2024 AWS started to charge not only unused IP addresses but by now all public IP Adresses.<br>
                    Together with the NAT costs, which have increased also a lot over the years, a VPC is now a 
                    considerable cost factor especially for small workloads.<br>
                    The costs on IP addresses are also a way of AWS to push more the usage of IPv6.<br>
                    Time to have a closer look on IPv6, because we are running out of IPv4 addresses and sooner o later we have to switch to IPv6.<br>
                    Even so, the adaption is still not so advanced, this will change for sure real soon, we should get ready for IPv6.
                    Take a look in this table on the support for IPv6 only:<br>
                    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ipv6-support.html" target="_blank">IPv6 Support</a><br>
                    As you can see the Dual Stack support option seems to be the better option for now. <br>
       
                    <br>
                    <h4>VPC Basics</h4><br>
                    Lets first look on a IPv4 VPC.<br>
                    As you might know, in IPv4 each computer or device has a IP address, which looks like this.<br>
                    <b>192.0.0.1 or 48.202.103.88</b> <br>
                    So 4 numbers from 0 to 255, each mumber is a octet (in binary 00000000 to 11111111).<br>
                    Thus a IPv4 address is 32 bits long.<br>
                    This gives us approximatly 4,3 billions of addresses.<br>
                    This might sound like a huge number for you, but in the age of mobile phones & IOT devices all over the world it is not so huge anymore and comes to its limits.<br>
                    <br>
                    There is also an important point on this to understand.<br>
                    In IPv6 we often use private IP Addresses AND a internet proxy, a NAT or IGW for internet communication. This is neccesary since the IP addresses are so limited.<br>
                    You have to differ between public and private IP addresses.
                    The private IP Ranges are for example 10.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0 and 192.168.0.0 .<br>
                    You can communicate in the internet to another server or device only by public IP.<br>
                    In your Intranet our VPC you can communicate via private IP address. <br>
                    Think of it like the public IP is a global unique address including country, city, postal code and street:<br>
                    20 W 34th St., New York, NY 10001, USA (Empire State Building)<br>
                    Inside the building you might have 3000 offices and an internal office building post office to deliver post from office 2020 to 1406.<br>
                    You can send internal post with just the office number ( private IP), but if you want to recieve post from Europe 
                    the public IP (full building address) is required.  <br>
                    
                    Instances or devices with such a private IP address communicate to other public IP addresses over the IP of a Proxy Server, the IGW or NAT ( therefore
                    it means Network address translation).<br>
                    This way many resources with a bunch of private IP addresses only are using and reserving one public IP address.<br>
                    
                    <br>
                    Now lets have a look on the structure of a IPv6 address:<br>
                    <b>2a05:d014:9be:9396:f365:96f6:8c78:c1ba</b><br>
                    As you can see IPv6 uses hexadecimal instead of decimal numbers like in IPv4. <br>
                    And is composed by 8 hexadecimal numbers instead of 4 decimal numbers ( 0-255)<br>
                    The first 4 hexadecimal numbers are used for the network part, the last 4 for the node-part.<br>
                    The IPv6 address space is organized by using format prefixes, that logically divide it in the form of a tree 
                    so that a route from one network to another can easily be found. <br>
                    The main categories of IPv6 addresses are:<br>
                    - Aggregatable global unicast addresses (GUA) — 2000::/3<br>
                    - Unique-local unicast addresses (ULA) — FC00::/7<br>
                    - Link-local unicast addresses — FE80::/10<br>
                    - Multicast addresses — FF00::/8<br>
                
                    A IPv6 address is 128 bit long.<br>
                    So we won't not run out of IPv6 addresses really soon.<br>
                    <br>
 
                    In IPv6 all public addresses are publicly routable, you don't need a NAT anymore<br>
                    You don't need to differ between private and public IPs.<br>
                    You can keep the model of private and public subnets to group different resource types like webservers public and <br>
                    databases private, but private subnet would mean not public reachable ( Routes, Security Groups etc) and not private IP addresses. <br>
                    If you want your instances can communicate to addresses outside your VPC, but are not public available from the internet,<br>
                     you can use a Egress only IGW instead of a NAT.<br>
                    NATs are no longer neccesary and therefor we can save costs with IPv6.<br>
                    Also there are no charges on IPv6 addresses...at least not yet and hopefully not so soon. <br>

                    
                    <br>
                    Btw. If you want to ping a IPv6 address you need the ping6 command:<br>
                    ping6 2a05:d014:9be:9396:f365:96f6:8c78:c1ba<br>
                    <br>
                    For curl you can use this command:<br>
                    curl -g -6 'http://[2a05:d014:1213:7900:476d:4f16:ffe0:ee16]:80/'<br>

                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>Setting up a VPC</h4><br>
                    If you want to set up a VPC in AWS you still will have to deal a little with IPv4, so it's a dual stack, not IPv6 only VPC.<br>
                    Meaning this you have to define a IPv4 CIDR Range (for example 10.0.0.0/24) for your VPC (even so you will use/create only IPv6 addresses)<br>
                    The IPv4 CIDR Range will be kind of insignificant.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>VPC</h5><br>
                    Lets create a VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets. 
                    So for a 10.0.0.0/16 VPC the CIDR Range for IPv6 will be /56 : <br>
                    2a05:d014:1213:7900::/56<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6vpc1.jpg" alt="ipv6-1" width="300"> <br>
                    <br>
                    If you want to use the Web Console and the wizard on the VPC dashboard, 
                    <br>your settings should look like this:<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6vpc0.jpg" alt="ipv6-0" width="300"> <br>
                    <br>
                    After the creation you should see in the VPC Settings : <br>
                    IPv6 pool = Amazon Associated and <br>
                    IPv6 CIDR = 2a05:d014:1213:7900::/56<br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Subnets</h5><br>
                    The IPv6 subnets will have this CIDR Range:<br>
                    Public: <br>
                    2a05:d014:1213:7900::/64<br>
                    2a05:d014:1213:7901::/64<br>
                    Private: <br>
                    2a05:d014:1213:7902::/64<br>
                    2a05:d014:1213:7903::/64<br>
                    (which is more or less 18 million trillion addresses for one subnet)<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6vpc2.jpg" alt="ipv6-2" width="300"> <br>
                    <br>
                    As you can see the subnets differ in the fourth number, to be precice in the hexadecimal pair (00 - FF) 2a05:d014:1213:79<b>00</b>::/64 <br>
                    <br>
                    Lets confim the settings for the subnets, important attributes are:<br>
                    IPv6-only: No for Dual Stack Yes for IPv6 Only.<br>
                    IPv6 CIDR: The CIDR Range for the subnet, will be /64 <br>
                    Auto-assign public IPv4 address: Can be No also for the public Subnet, because we will use IPv6 addresses instead of IPv4. <br>
                    DNS64: should be Enabled<br>
                    Resource name DNS AAAA record: should be Enabled<br>

                    <br>
                    <h5>Routes</h5><br>
                    Our public subnets must have routes for local traffic and also to the IGW for traffic to the internet.<br>
                    So it should look like this:<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6vpc3.jpg" alt="ipv6-3" width="300"> <br><br>
                    The private routes must have routes for local traffic and optionally - for internet traffic - routes to a Engress only IGW.<br>
                    There is also a entry to a managed prefix list for the private subnets.<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6vpc4.jpg" alt="ipv6-4" width="300"> <br>
                    A managed prefix list is a set of one or more CIDR blocks. You can use prefix lists to make it easier to configure and <br>
                    maintain your security groups and route tables.<br>
                    If we take a closer look to this prefix list, it is com.amazonaws.region.s3, one of 8 aws managed prefix lists.<br>
                    The entry for the S3 Prefix list was automatically added by the wizard, it got 10 entries to CIDR ranges and <br>
                    seems to be neccesary for accessing S3 from our private IPv6 subnets. <br>
                    I will have to make some tests on my self created IPv6 VPC, if accessing S3 is also possible without this prefix list. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Security Groups</h5><br>
                    For Security Groups you also must specifiy the IPv6 behaviour.<br>
                    Allowing the internet communication in IPv4 is 	0.0.0.0/0, meanwhile in IPv6 ::/0.<br>
                    For internal VPC communication it will be the CIDR range of your VPC or subnets,<br>
                    so for example <br>
                    2a05:d014:1213:7900::/56<br>
                    or for subnets<br> 
                    2a05:d014:1213:7902::/64<br>
                    Security Group chaining wil not change, if you select another SG as source, this works the same way as in IPv4.<br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Infrastructure as Code</h4><br>
                    For our evaluation and for first POCs it's fine to create the resources on the Web-Console. <br>
                    But for production workloads and therefore sooner or later we have to create them with IaC. <br>
                    I have created a Github Repo with IaC Examples for IPv6 for CloudFormation, CDK and Terraform.<br>
                    First examples  are already available, but the repo is in work, keep that in mind. <br>
                    Stay tuned !<br>
                    The repo (under construction) is :<br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
                    With the new costs on IP addresses and also the NAT costs on AWS, its time to have a closer look on IPv6<br>
                    Even so the adaption is still not yet as far as it should be, we should get prepared to use IPv6 in the future.<br>
                    Take a look at this table showing the support for AWS services. <br>
                    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ipv6-support.html" target="_blank">IPv6 Support</a><br>
                    Currently the Dual Stack option is the best one, IPv6 only is not yet an option.<br>
                    But even with the Dual Stack option an Hybrid VPCs we can already save money and reduce our costs on NATs and public IPv4 addresses. <br>
                    Take also a look into this blog for how to run EC2 instances with IPv6.<br>
