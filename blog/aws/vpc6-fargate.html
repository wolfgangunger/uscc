                    <h4>By Wolfgang Unger</h4><br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
                    <br>
                    How to run a Fargate or ECS Service on IPv6 ? 
                    This short tutorial will try to explain this challenge<br>
                    <br>
                    AWS accounced already some time ago ECS and Fargate now also supports IPv6 Dual Stack.<br>
                    It is also listed in the supported Dual Stack services, see <br>
                    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ipv6-support.html" target="_blank">IPv6 Support</a><br>
                    So let's try it out, if it really works. <br>
                    But on my tests, I figured out, it's not really easy running a Fargate Service in a private Subnet in a IPv6 dual-stack Subnet.<br>
                    You will face a couple of problems and have to perform a couple of steps to get it running.<br>
                    Let's cover in this blog, what is required to get it working. <br>


                    <br>
                    <h4>VPC</h4><br>
                    First we need a VPC in dual-stack mode, please have a look into this blog how to set it up.<br>
                    <a href="vpc6-introduction.html" class="page-scroll">VPC IPv6 Introduction</a><br>
                    You will also find some examples for CloudFormation, Terraform and CDK in my Github Repo to 
                    create the VPC with IaC .<br>
                    <a href="https://github.com/wolfgangunger/aws-ipv6" class="page-scroll" target="_blank">Github
                        Wolfgang Unger - AWS IPv6</a><br>
                    Make sure you have public and private Subnets and the Routes are setup correct.<br>
                    No NAT should be existing, only a EgressOnly IGW.<br>
                    The private Subnets should route IPv6 traffic through the EgressOnly IGW.<br>
                    IPv4 traffic will not be possible from the private Subnets to the internet, since we got no NAT.<br>
                    (This will cause us problems later on )<br>

                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>ECS/Fargate Preconditions </h4><br>
                    AWS accounced IPv6 is not supported for Fargate and ECS but forget to mention a little detail.<br>
                    You have to enable IPv6 Support in your Account ECS settings, its disable by default in February 2024 <br>
                    As you might know in the Elastic Container Service you have Account Settings in the menu on the left side.<br>
                    Unfortunatelly you can't set it here. You need to activate IPv6 with CLI.<br>
                    Either by :<br>
                    <i>aws ecs put-account-setting-default --name dualStackIPv6 --value enabled (--region eu-west-1)</i><br>
                    or<br>
                    <i>aws ecs put-account-setting --name dualStackIPv6 --value enabled (--region eu-west-1)</i><br>
                    with or region parameter for one region or without for all regions. <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>ECR and Docker Container </h4><br>
                    Of course we need a Container to run and also a Repo to store the Image.<br>
                    I will use a simple httpd Container for my tests. <br>
                    You find the Dockerfile also in my repo in /docker.<br>
                    We will run a image  FROM httpd:2.4<br>
                    Next we need a ECR repo to upload and later on pull our image, so lets 
                    create a ECR private Repo.<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6-fargate1.jpg" alt="fargate1" width="300"> <br>
                    After building our httpd Image we push it to our ECR Repo <br>
                    <i>docker push account.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecs-repository-ipv6:httpd</i><br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>ECS Cluster and Task Definition</h4><br>
                    Now we can create our Cluster and a Task Definition to run on later. <br>
                    For the Cluster is not much to configure, for the Task Definition we will define:<br>
                    NetworkMode: awsvpc<br>
                    App Environment : Fargate <br>
                    the Container Port ( can be 80 to start) and a Execution Role for Fargate.<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6-fargate2.jpg" alt="fargate2" width="300"> <br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Create the Service</h4><br>
                    Now we can create a Service based on our Task Definition.<br><br>
                    We will define :<br>
                    Our Cluster <br>
                    Launch Type: Fargate <br>
                    Application Type : Service <br>
                    Service Name: httpd <br>
                    Desired Tasks: 1<br>
                    Networking:<br>
                    &ensp;Our IPv6 dual-stack VPC <br>
                    &ensp;Subnets: Our private Subnets <br>
                    &ensp;Security Group : Create one or chose an existing one, make sure you have Port 80 open for IPv6 and IPv4 . Will become an issue later on <br>
                    &ensp;Public IP : Turned Off<br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Run the Service</h4><br>
                    Lets run our service and see what will happen. <br>
                    It will create a service httpd in our cluster and try to run a task.<br>
                    But the taks will not start successfully, after 3 attempts to deploy the task, it will fail: <br>
                    <i>ResourceInitializationError: unable to pull secrets or registry auth: execution resource retrieval failed: <br>
                    unable to retrieve ecr registry auth: service call has been retried 3 time(s): RequestError: <br>
                    send request failed caused by: Post "https://api.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/": dial tcp [64:ff9b::a00:1322]:443: i/o timeout. Please check your task network configuration.</i><br>
                    During the deployment attempts I took a look on the task, it recieved an ENI with a private IPv4 and IPv6 address. <br>
                    No public IPv6 address, by purpose. <br>
                    Looks like the taks can't pull the image with IPv6 from ECR. And with IPv4 it will work neither, since I have <br>
                    no NAT and routes to the internet for IPv4. <br>
                    I will try one more time, for now in the public subnet and Public IP : Turned On.<br>
                    The service becomes healthy, so our Docker Image is fine and our Cluster also works in general.<br>
                    The problem seems that the Enpoint for ECR is not IPv6 ready. <br>
                    We will need to pull our Image with IPv4. <br>

                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>Create VPC endpoints for ECR</h4><br>
                    Since our VPC got no routes for private IPv4 addresses to the internet and we also got no plans to add a NAT, <br>
                    we need to create VPC enpoints to enable our task to pull the image from ECR with IPv4 address<br>
                    See the Amazon documentation on <br>
                    <a href=" https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html" class="page-scroll" target="_blank">Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints</a><br>
                    <br>
                    In VPC you find endpoints in the left menu, select create Endoint and create <br>
                    2 interface Endpoints for <br>
                    com.amazonaws.region.ecr.dkr<br>
                    and <br>
                    com.amazonaws.region.ecr.api<br>
                    both linked to your IPv6 VPC and private Subnets. <br>
                    You need to create also a Gateway Endpoint to <br>
                    com.amazonaws.region.s3<br>
                    <br>
                    I struggled on this part, because the documentation doesn't mention an important detail.<br>
                    It's not enough to create these 3 endpoints, the interface endpoints must also have <br>
                    your fargate security group assigned. When creating the endpoint, it will only assign the Default SG of the VPC. <br>
                    If you run your Service with the Default SG you won't have a problem, but I am deploying the <br>
                    Service with IaC and have a dedicated SG for my Service. This caused me a headache.<br>
                    So, don't forget to add your Service Security Group to the 2 interface endpoints.<br>
                    <br>
                    Keep in mind, these enpoints are not for free, one will cost us about 7$ a month (not included data transfer costs). <br>
                    So this is not really a much better solution than a NAT, I hope, we will see IPv6 support for ECR soon. <br>
                    <br>
                    Will our Service now finally become healthy? <br>
                    No... at least not, if we enable Log Collection on the Task Definition. <br>
                    The communication from the task to CloudWatch will fail. We would need another enpoint (com.amazonaws.region.logs), to enable this.<br>
                    But I am a little frustrated and out of patience now, so I simply disable Log Collection for now.<br>
                    And ....Eureka ! The Service becomes healthy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6-fargate3.jpg" alt="fargate3" width="300"> <br>
                    <br>
                    Lets look at our task, respectively on the Network Settings:<br>
                    <img src="img/ipv6-fargate4.jpg" alt="fargate4" width="300"> <br>
                    No public IP, a private IPv4 address and and a IPv6 address. <br>
                    The ENI also got both addresses. <br>
                    <br>
                    It was a hard piece of work, but finally the service is running . <br>
                    Thanks for Joel Brandenburg from AWS for giving me support on the VPC enpoints part. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>ALB in front of the Service</h4><br>
                    I have a example in my Github Repo with a Fargate Service with a ALB.<br>
                    There is also still an issue here.<br>
                    We cannot select IpAddressType: ipv6 on the TargetGroup.<br>
                    Our Dual Stack Fargate Service will pass its IPv4 address, not the IPv6 address and this will cause an error. <br>
                    For now we have to register the fargate service as target with its IPv4 address.<br>
                    Therefore :<br>
                    <i>IpAddressType: ipv4<br>
                    TargetType: ip<br>
                </i>
                    <br>
                    <h4>IaC</h4><br>
                    For your first tests you should try by WebConsole, this will keeps things easier.<br>
                    Once you got your service running, you can start with Iac.<br>
                    Have a look in my Repo, wou will find examples there, 
                    the repo is in work, keep that in mind. 
                    Stay tuned<br>
                    The repo (under construction) is :<br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
                    It is quite some work to get a Fargate Service running for the first time and find and solve all issues.<br>
                    Out of the box, your service will not become healthy.<br>
                    You have to enable dualStackIPv6 ECS setting for your account first with CLI.<br>
                    The ECR enpoint is not IPv6 ready. 
                    You won't be able to pull the image by IPv6 (February 2024).<br>
                    So it must be via the IPv4 address of the task/ENI. <br>
                    Therefore we need VPC endpoints if we don't want to add a NAT. <br>
