                    <h4>By Wolfgang Unger</h4><br>
                    <p> 
                        <h4>Introduction</h4><br>
                        Are you planning to get a AWS certification within the next time?<br>
                        For example the Solutions Architect Associate or to your first one the Cloud Practitioner?<br>
                        This blog will provide you some tips how to prepare for it and pass it.<br>
                        We will talk about 5 important things to know:<br>
                        <b>
                        - Know IAM & Security<br>
                        - Know VPC & Networking<br>
                        - Know the services<br>
                        - Know the 5 pillars<br>
                        - Read the keywords<br>
                    </b>
                    <br>

                        You can also download this Powerpoint with additional infos and example questions:<br>
                        <a href="doc/certification.pptx" download>Certification Powerpoint</a> <br>
                        <br>

                        <h4>Know IAM & Security</h4><br>
                        <h4>Know VPC & Networking</h4><br>
                        You don't have to know all 200 aws services by heart, more about this in the chapter 'Know the services',<br>
                        but IAM ( and Security) and VPC & Networking are really essential and without a profound knowledge on <br>
                        them, you will have for sure difficulties to pass most of the exams. <br>
                        Also if you want not just to pass the certification, but work on AWS, you will need this knowledge every day. <br>
                        For IAM make sure you really know these entities:<br>
                        Users<br>
                        Roles<br>
                        Groups<br>
                        Policies<br>
                        Identy Providers<br>
                        Cognito<br><br>
                        For Security read the Security whitepaper and get a good understanding how to secure resources on AWS, <br>
                        know the most important Security Services like
                        GuardDuty, WAS, SecurityHub, Macie, Shied and more <br>
                        <br>
                        Concerning VPC and Networking be sure you know really well these entities:<br>
                        VPC Security ( SGs, ACLs, VPN etc)<br>
                        Subnets<br>
                        ACLs<br>
                        Endpoints<br>
                        Gateways<br>
                        CloudFront<br>
                        Route53<br>



                        <br>
      
                        <h4>Know the services</h4><br>
                        What about the other 200 AWS Services? You don't know them by heart, probably nobody knows all of them really in detail,<br>
                        but there a couple of really often used services, you must well and for other services, you should know <br>
                        at least the very basic description of this service and what it does or serves for. <br>
                        On these services a good knowledge is really recommended to pass the exams :<br>
                        VPC & Networking, CloudFront, Route53<br>
                        Security, Identy & Complience<br>
                        Computing, API Gateway<br>
                        Storage<br>
                        Databases<br>
                        Management<br>
                        Developer Tools<br>
                        <br>
                        For all other services take at least one look on the AWS high level description in the documentation of the service.<br>
                        For example Kinesis, the description from AWS on this service is :<br>
                        "Amazon Kinesis cost-effectively processes and analyzes streaming data at any scale as a fully managed service. <br>
                        With Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data, such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, <br>
                        and IoT telemetry data, for machine learning (ML), analytics, and other applications."<br>
                        Try to remember the key words of the description, you might get a question where a service is required, <br>
                        that "ingest real-time data" or "processes and analyzes streaming data" . Once you read this, there is <br>
                        a high chance, they are asking for Kinesis. <br>
                        <br>
                        DynamoDB as a second example:<br>
                        "Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. <br>
                        DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools"<br>
                        So if you read "key-value", "NoSQL Database" and "serverless" you know what they are looking for.<br>








                        <br> 
                        <h4>Know the 5 pillars</h4><br>
                        You definitely have to know the 5 pillars ( by now 6) of the Well Architected Framework.<br>
                        The Well Architected Framework whitepaper is a must read to prepare for the certifications.<br>
                        <br>
                        Operational Excellence<br>
                        The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedure<br>
                        <br>
                        Security<br>
                        The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategie<br>
                        <br>
                        Reliability<br>
                        The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources <br>
                        to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconﬁgurations or transient network issue<br>
                        <br>
                        Performance Eﬃciency<br>
                        The ability to use computing resources eﬃciently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that eﬃciency as demand changes <br>
                        and technologies evolve<br>
                        <br>
                        Cost Optimization <br>
                        The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price poin<br>
                        <br>
                        Sustainability<br>
                        The discipline of sustainability addresses the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities. <br>
                        You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Sustainability Pillar whitepaper.<br>
                        <br>
                        Questions will often focus on one of these 5/6 pillars and the answer might ambiguous or there it might seem there are <br>
                        more than one valid answers, but if you figure out the focus of the question, more about this in the next chapter, <br>
                        it will become more clear, what the correct answer is in deed. <br>


                        <br>
                        <h4>Read the keywords</h4><br>
                        This is maybe the most valuable tip of all of 5, especially when it comes to the professional and speciality exams.<br>
                        Most of the questions are really long with extensively description or details. <br>
                        For my taste really too long. I often asked myself did Tolstoi wrote the question? <br>
                        Some of them can be ignored but some little words - some key words - are the game changer about the correct answer.<br>
                        Often you will have to choose between multiple presumably correct answers. At least from the aspect of this answer <br>
                        is a valid architecture desing or choice. <br>
                        But only one of them is really the correct one. <br>
                        This will very often depend on little keywords in the question, you have to figure out in the question<br>
                        Some examples are:<br>
                        …scalable solution..<br>
                        …highly available<br>
                        ….security issues<br>
                        …the most cost effective way<br>
                        <br>
                        For example if one solution has a  Multi AZ RDS Cluster and the other one got a RDS with a Read Replica, <br>
                        the correct choice might depend if they asked for "highly available" Database or if the focus was "increase read performance".<br>
                        Often the cost aspect will make the change. For other questions the realibity makes the differ. <br>
                        <br>
                        Here is one example question:<br>
                        "A company is planning to launch an application which requires a data warehouse that will be used for their infrequently accessed data. <br>
                        You need to use an EBS Volume that can handle large, sequential I/O operations.<br>
                        Which of the following is the most cost-effective storage type that you should use to meet the requirement?"<br>
                        1. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)<br>
                        2. EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)<br>
                        3. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)<br>
                        4. Cold HDD (sc1)<br>
                        <br>
                        These words will guide you to the correct answer: <br>
                        large, sequential, cost-effective<br>
                        Which is valid for : 4 Code HDD<br><br>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
                        I hope  these tips will help you on your preparation for the exam and later on to pass it.<br> Good luck ! <br>
